# CS135_FinalProject
This is a respository for our CS135 final project.

Our application, TutorMatch, is designed to be a simple way for students at college campuses to be able to easily find tutors in the subject of their choosing.

To run out code, download all the files.  Put them in /MAMP/htdocs, and run it off of mamp.  Make sure to install the DB in our code via the following code in terminal:
  /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/mysql -u root -p < /Applications/MAMP/htdocs/CS135_FinalProject-master/tm_ddl.sql
